      "[None, None, 'Great effort in this topic Taj. You always had your pre-learning completed on time, but I don\\'t think you put a lot of thought into your \"I can\" statements. These are important to help you focus your mind on what are the key concepts for a lesson and will also guide me in supporting you. Your hard work with the pre-learning saw your mini tests results improve as the topic when on. Keep working hard at those skills because they are what will help you work your way to the end of high school and beyond. You did find the topic test more difficult. That was designed to be difficult with some lateral thinking and problem solving applications of the Linear relations we learnt in this topic. As soon as the questions got difficult or you were unsure you stopped answering them. Next time try something. If you get the right answer from previous mistakes you will still get some marks. The more you do these type of tests the better you will get. I also recommend you spend more time on the problem solving and reasoning questions in class. ', None, \"Junru you had a late start to the unit because of your corona virus quarantine, so as a result you took a little time to get used to the process that we're running in each class.  Despite this I think you could greatly improve the amount of pre-learning you complete. Despite this you have demonstrated a high level of ability and understanding with great results in the mini tests, especially algebra and simultaneous equations. However, There could be improvement with linear graphs. In fact, this demonstrates that you have begun this year with a good grasp of algebra skills but by not completing enough pre-learning you haven't developed enough skills in graphing linear relations. Your topic test repeated your mini test results. Overall, a strong result that could have been better with more application to all aspects of linear graphs. \", None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Ollie you have worked consistently through this unit. You have completed nearly all of the pre-learning on time and your mini test results show a good understanding of nearly all the material covered, though you might want to sure up your knowledge in linear graphs.  Your responses to the \"I can\" statements indicates you have a lot of confidence in linear relations. I was very pleased with your results in the topic test, though you wrote the answer to a few questions with no working so I am not sure how you found your answers. You also left a few questions blank. Considering you do work hard at your maths and have a fair bit of confidence I suggest you have a go and try questions you\\'re unsure of. Keep up the great work Ollie you demonstrate all of the right skills to achieve strong results in mathematics. ', 'Cherish, you have come a long way in this unit. In the beginning you were finding the material very difficult but towards the end you got stronger and stronger and by the end you have achieved a good result in the topic test. The level of difficulty you found in this topic is reflected in your \"I can\" statements. It was very exciting to see this effort rewarded with such strong results in the simultaneous equations mini test. Despite working very hard in class, you were also not completing your pre-learning on time. I have a sense that you\\'re getting your head around that now and began to get into a good rhythm by the end of the topic. I thought it was great that you attempted most questions on the end of topic test. It was designed to be challenging, so there is no shame in not being able to do some questions. There were a few questions left blank though, if you want to take your learning to a new level make sure you get well beyond the pre-learning questions in each exercise and try some of the extra questions I give you, including the challenges in the videos. ', None, None, None, None, 'KIeran, after a slow start this year you have really kicked into gear since. Your laid back attitude can\\'t hide how hard you are actually working! Throughout this unit you made sure you completed your pre-learning on time,  but I am not convinced you put a lot of thought into your \"I can\" statements. Your result on the topic test was not as strong as what you had on the latter mini tests, but that is because it was designed to be a difficult task requiring lateral thinking and problem solving. I thought, you demonstrated some good skills with most aspects of linear graphs and simultaneous equations. Unfortunately, one little algebra mistake cost you a few marks. It was great that you tried to work though this later in the test. Keep working hard at your pre-learning and mastering the mini tests. Those are the skills that will carry you into VCE and beyond. The more you do topic tests like this the better you will be at them. ', None, None, [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], \"Great overall for this topic Gabriel. You have put in a consistent effort in class and contributed to class discussion and worked well with Jasper. You both ask me lots of really good questions. Your results on the mini tests are very encouraging, particularly those that relate to the lessons you did all of the pre-learning with. This topic test was designed to be challenging, so while you didn't achieve the same score as you have on the mini tests you did demonstrate some good skills. Now we need to start combining your lateral thinking with the skills that you're building. Keep up the good work, you are demonstrating of the skills to be a successful maths student. \", 'Nicholas, you should be very proud of your efforts in this topic. You have consistently been an active member in our class and have completed all of the pre-learning required. This work ethic has served you well as your results got better and better in the mini tests. You have also asked me very good questions and made the most of tutors and catch up sessions. In the final test for the topic your were very impressive. You demonstrated all of the key skills covered and were able to apply them in questions that were designed to be challenging. Even when you did make most mistakes you kept persisting. Keep up the great work. ', \"Fantastic result in your topic test Magnus. You worked hard consistently from the start of class to the finish and always came to class with your pre-learning complete. You achieved differing results in the mini tests, and still need to catch up on the first mini test. However, I was really pleased with how well you completed the topic test. This was a very challenging test designed to make you draw connections between different concepts and think laterally. Your successful achievement in this test demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concepts taught. It also demonstrates a confidence to persist when challenged. It is fair reward for the hard work and persistence you show in class and with your pre-learning. Keep it up, you're going to have a very successful year if you do. \", 'Jasper, you are working very hard in maths and always bring great enthusiasm and intellectual curiosity. You have been consistently up to date with your pre-learning and provide some honest and mature responses to the \"I can\" statements, that are a good reflection of your results in the mini tests. This means you need to put some time into simultaneous equations still. This is a very important concept and it will only be extended in your future maths study, so lets get the fundamentals secure now. This may be a reason why you didn\\'t get a result on the topic test that reflects your results over the majority of the mini tests. Do not let this dent your confidence because the test was designed to be challenging and required you draw connections between different concepts that were learnt in this topic. Because you didn\\'t see the connection between the simultaneous  equations in the graph you weren\\'t able to find the distance between points, and so on. In the future I recommend you just put what you think it is and then work from there. You will get marks working from mistakes in previous questions if your working is correct, taking those mistakes into consideration. Keep up with the hard work Jasper. This work ethic and intellectual curiosity you have are the key ingredients to long term success in mathematics. ', 'Not attempted', 'Fantastic result in the topic test Caelan. You should be very proud of your ability to work through challenging questions that require reasoning and problem solving skills. You should also be proud of how well you have progressed with your mini test results. There is still room for improvement in completing pre-learning on time. Considering your test results and the level of confidence you have displayed in your responses to \"I can\" statements the sky is the limit for you. I think you should be working on improving in this area and making sure you complete detailed reference sheets. ', \"Oscar, you are a constant positive presence in the classroom. Your enthusiasm for any lateral thinking and class talks is very refreshing. Unfortunately, you have not been able to find the time or energy to consistently complete your pre-learning and that is showing on your assessments. There are quite a few key concepts that you're finding difficult. You're also not directly asking me for help on them because by not completing the pree-learning you're not sure what you don't know until after an assessment. In so many things you do, most notably your software development/coding skills and enthusiasm for logic, shows me that you should be a very successful mathematics student. However, you're now studying at a level that requires consistent work for even the best students. Lets not get dismayed with your results in this topic. I suggest that you work with the tutors after school most nights. That way you can get all of your maths homework with someone to bounce ideas off. One hour after school for Mondays to Thursdays will be all you need. In that time you can resit all of the mini tests you need to. If you are able to do this I fully expect you to achieve great results in mathematics and open many more computer science doors for you. \", 'Emma, there is no doubt that you have found the beginning of pre-methods very difficult. At this stage you have not been able to commit to the amount of pre-learning required. I know that it may seem like a huge mountain to climb at this stage but I know you can get a lot out of this year. We can speak about alternative pathways for you and we can offer a modified assessment type to give you time to build up your confidence. I know if you put the work in and we make some adjustments for you that by the end of this year we will be able to get a lot out of this year. However, it is going to require consistent effort from you and I also suggest you make the most of the tutors we have available. ', 'Eden, you have worked exceptionally hard all unit. You have also tried to get the most support out of me and some of the tutors we have. Your completion of pre-learning as been exceptional and your responses to \"I can\" statements show that you\\'re very clear on what you do and don\\'t understand. That takes a high level of maturity and also completing a high volume of work to find out what you don\\'t understand. I am very pleased to see your results in the mini tests getting stronger as the year progresses. I hope your confidence will match your progress soon. Your result on the topic test wasn\\'t as strong as the mini tests, but that is because it was designed to be more challenging and encourage you to draw connections between different concepts we have been learning. Despite not finding it easy you attempted all questions in a way that shows that you really tried to think about them. Keep up the hard work. You can see the results in your mini tests, you will soon see the results in your topic tests. ', 'Well done Maiya, It is very pleasing to see you get reward for all the effort and care you put into your work. You have consistently pushed yourself to be up to date with all of the pre-learning and shown great insight into what you need help with. Your \"I can\" statements reflect a young person who thinks deeply about what you do and don\\'t know. You have also made the most out of me by actively seeking support in all of the mediums we have at our disposal. Your hard work saw your mini test results improve throughout the unit. However, I was most impressed with your responses to the topic test. This test was designed to be challenging and require some lateral thought. You nearly answered everything and you showed real clarity in being able to see the connections between all of the concepts taught. Perhaps your fantastic reference notes helped you. Keep persisting Maiya. You show all of the signs of a student who will achieve great things in mathematics. ', 'Not attempted', 'Vandana you have performed amazingly well throughout this topic. You have a perfect record on completing your pre-learning and have put in a huge effort to complete extra tasks with printed booklets of extra tasks. I think your responses to the \"I can\" statements show a lot of maturity as well. On top of all this hard work you are constantly asking me fantastic questions about the concepts that are being taught. I know you were expecting a higher mark in your topic test, but it was designed to force you to draw connections between different topics and think laterally. It was the first time you have seen a test like this and I think you did very well. Despite not being able to complete every answer perfectly you still tried to answer everything with what you had. All of the skills you have acquired and the learning habits you display demonstrate that the sky is the limit for you in maths class. Keep up this amazing effort. ', 'Thomas, you have demonstrated a high level of skill in mathematics which is matched by a your enthusiasm for this subject. In class you have contributed to class discussions and shared your thinking with the whole class. This is a great attribute to have and will help you continue developing. Not only do you bring enthusiasm to the subject, you have committed yourself to completing all of the pre-learning on time. Your results in the mini tests demonstrate an almost complete mastery of the key skills and your responses to \"I can\" demonstrate that you recognise that and have a lot of confidence in maths. The topic test was designed to be challenging and you tried hard on all the questions. You did get caught out on a few, but still went on to complete them all. If you want to improve your results in the topic test I suggest you bring in permitted reference material, work on the extra hand outs and spend class time completing all of the problem solving to enrichment questions in class. ', \"Well done Caitlin. You managed to achieve a good result in the topic test after finding the mini tests very difficult. Despite not getting the results you would have liked in those mini tests you continued to turn up every class and work as hard as you can from start to finish every class. While I would like to encourage you to ask from more help when you are finding it hard I can also see that you find pleasure, and the aptitude to just persist on your own. This hard working and can do attitude is why you have achieved a good mark on the topic test. It was designed to be challenging and force you to make connections between different concepts in this topic.  You did a great job with lateral thinking in some parts, and where you weren't able to totally succeed in all parts of each question you continued to complete all of the parts you could. Keep working hard and revising. You are showing all of the signs of a student who is going to very successful in mathematics. \", 'Not attempted', \"Fynn you have attended nearly every class and worked hard every time. However, you are rarely completing any of the pre-learning. It has become clear during this topic that there are a few skills that you still need to work hard to acquire. This means that it is vital that you complete your pre-learning and do extra things like redoing mini tests or seeking tutor support. This class is tough enough as it is, so you need to give yourself every chance to succeed. If you do persist in trying to master every concept on time you find that it will all start to fall into place. If you don't do this it will start seem harder and harder and it will be even more difficult to find the motivation to catch up. \", 'Keisha you have been an enthusiastic member of class and demonstrated independent learning skills. Both of these indicate a high level of maturity. You have done the majority of your pre-learning on schedule, but due to your many other commitments have had patches when you have needed to catch up. Your mini test results surprisingly don\\'t reflect the where you have completed all of the pre-learning, but I know you have caught up where needed. Your responses to the \"I can\" statements show that you\\'re considering honestly what you do and don\\'t know. Your result on the topic test was very good and reflected your results in the mini tests. You were able to use lateral thinking to draw the exact linear graphs the question was asking, but weren\\'t able to then relate that to simultaneous equations. Keep up the hard work, you\\'re demonstrating the skills and attitude that will lead to success in mathematics. ', \"Aimee, what I like about you is how you always persist and bring a positive attitude to every class. Pre-Methods is a very tough version of year 10 maths and 1 year ahead of schedule you are already attempting it. You found yourself a bit behind early in this topic but you persisted until you caught up. Being behind would have made completing the mini-tests difficult. These were all about the core skills. Then in the topic test you were pushed with some much more challenging questions that often combined a few of the concepts. I know you're working hard with home learning by the fact that you have caught up. I want you to think about using the school tutors. Perhaps you could consider doing your homework in their presence after school. They will help you get over anything that makes you feel stuck so you can progress quicker through the material. Whatever you choose Aimee, keep on persisting. I know you will get there. \", 'Excellent work Anton. You have demonstrated a high level of understanding in Linear Algebra. This is to be expected considering how you managed to consistently finish all of your pre-learning through the last half of the topic. Your response to \"I can\" statements shows that you have a good level of confidence too. Your reference sheet had some good reminders of key concepts, but it was fairly sparse and there was no effort to make things stand out on it. I am very pleased with how well you attempted all of the challenging questions on the topic test. Keep up the hard work. While I would suggest that you attempt the extra task handouts, I understand that you need to try to get through as much of the year as possible prior to moving to the Ukraine.
